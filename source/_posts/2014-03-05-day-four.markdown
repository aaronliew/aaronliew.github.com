{% img center /images/DayFour/Toast.JPG LinearLayout %}

In the initial development, Toast method was used to show the popup message
after pressing the search button. There are two types of layout: relative layout
and linear layout.

In activity_main.xml code, the 'RelativeLayout'is changed to the 'LinearLayout'. 
The layout is set in vertical orientation as shown in the figure below.

First of all, the id of the radiobuttons are set as shown below. The red circles is id
of the widgets whereas the green circle is the text of the widgets.
