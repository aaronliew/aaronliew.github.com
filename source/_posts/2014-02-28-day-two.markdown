First of all, user will insert text into the textbox and press the 'send' button. 
In MainActivity class, the 'intent' object store the values. Next, the DisplayMessageActivity 
will display the message which is inserted by the user. In order to have clearer picture on the 
operation of Android app and interactions between classes, I have created the charts as shown below.
