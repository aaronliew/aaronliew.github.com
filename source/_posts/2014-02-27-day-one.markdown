Today, my primary task was to create blog using Octopress in order to
write down the progress of my android development.
First of all, after setup the Octopress, there are two commands needed to 
create the .MarkDown extension file, set the title of the post, and preview the blog
: rake preview and rake new_post. The explanation of the commands
is shown in the figure below.

After creating the new post, I have made amendments in _config yml file 
in order to configure the title, subtitle and author of the blog. The code
of yml file is shown in the figure below.
